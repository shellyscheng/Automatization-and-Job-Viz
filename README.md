# Will You Lose Your Jobs in 2030?

"The technology-driven world in which we live is a world filled with promise but also challenges. Cars that drive themselves, machines that read X-rays, and algorithms that respond to customer-service inquiries are all manifestations of powerful new forms of automation. Yet even as these technologies increase productivity and improve our lives, their use will substitute for some work activities humans currently perform—a development that has sparked much public concern."

This visualization work highlights scenarios for the future of work in our six focus countries: China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States. "The charts show a range of possible outcomes for jobs displaced by automation adoption to 2030 and scenarios for future jobs that could be created by seven catalysts of labor demand, as well as by new occupations that could arise."
